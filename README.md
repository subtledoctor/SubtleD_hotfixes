# SubtleD_hotfixes
 various little hotfix mods

v1. z_MnG_4_5_bard_flag_hotfix

If your MnG Revised bards - or Enchanters - cannot cast illusion spells, this will remove the exclusion flag that is stopping them.

DEPRECATED - This has become unnecessary with the latest versions of MnG.

v2. Revert some SR changes

DEPRECATED - This was done as a favor to undo a few changes made by Spell Revisions. Don't generally use this.

v3. zz_Bard_Slot_Fix

This will fix the way MnG Revised Bards' casting slots work, so they don't get screwed up if someone leaves the party and then re-joins.

DEPRECATED - This will be irrelevant as of MnG v4.9.5. 

v4. 5E_Spellcasting_hotfix

Fixes a pretty serious flaw in the 0.6 version of the 5E Spellcasting Conversion mod. 

This will be irrelevant as of v0.7 of the 5E Casting mod.
For the Arcanist kit, this will be irrelevant as of Tome & Blood v0.9.8.
For Revised Bards, this will be irrelevant as of Might & Guile v4.11.1
