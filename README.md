 various little hotfix mods

v1. z_MnG_4_5_bard_flag_hotfix

If your MnG Revised bards - or Enchanters - cannot cast illusion spells, this will remove the exclusion flag that is stopping them.

DEPRECATED - This has become unnecessary with the latest versions of MnG.

v2. Revert some SR changes

DEPRECATED - This was done as a favor to undo a few changes made by Spell Revisions. Don't generally use this.

v3. zz_Bard_Slot_Fix

This will fix the way MnG Revised Bards' casting slots work, so they don't get screwed up if someone leaves the party and then re-joins.

DEPRECATED - This will be irrelevant as of MnG v4.9.5. 

v4. 5E_Spellcasting_hotfix

Fixes a pretty serious flaw in the 0.6 version of the 5E Spellcasting Conversion mod. 

This will be irrelevant as of v0.7 of the 5E Casting mod.
For the Arcanist kit, this will be irrelevant as of Tome & Blood v0.9.8.
For Revised Bards, this will be irrelevant as of Might & Guile v4.11.1

v5. Revised Identify Hotfix

This makes the Revised Identify spell work if you installed it via Tome & Blood 0.9.6 - 0.9.9.

This is irrelevant as of Tome & Blood v0.9.10.

v6. 5E Casting Priests

This fixes v0.9 of the 5E Casting mod such that priest spell slots are properly affected.

This is irrelevant as of v1.0 of the 5E Casting mod.

v7. FnP Hivekeeper Rhino Beetle Form

This fixes a bug that crashes the game when you shapeshift into a Rhino Beetle

This is irrelevant as of v0.79.30 of Faiths & Powers.

v8. SoB Robes Spellcasting Hotfix

This fixes items of type=2 ("armor") such as mage robes that had an errant opcode 145 effect applied by the YARAS component of Scales of Blance v5.33.

This is irrelevant as of v5.33.2 of Scales of Balance.

v9. SoB Crossbow Crash Hotfix

This fixes light crossbows which had their "2-handed" flag removed by the "Functional Weapon Tweaks" component of Scales of Blance v5.33. This hotfix only installs on the pre-EE engine, where the missing flag will cause a crash.

This is irrelevant as of v5.34 of Scales of Balance.

v10. Spell Revisions and breaking invisibility in EE v2.6+

This sets the appropriate flags in spells overwritten or added by SR 4b18, such that they break invisibility and sanctuary properly in the EE v2.6 engine.

This is irrelevant as of Spell Revisions v4 beta 19

v11. NPC_EE Upgrade from v4 -> v5

This can be installed over NPC_EE v4 on an existing game and will update the functionality to v5. On new games, just install NPC_EE v5.

v12. Sorcerer spell learning fix for Tome & Blood v0.9.23

This fixes single-class sorcerer spell learning when "Sorcerer Spell Switching" is installed from Tome & Blood v0.9.23.

This is irrelevant as of Tome & Blood v0.9.24
